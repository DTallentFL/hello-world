# hello-world
This will be my first repository (used to test Git)
I have been using TFS for years, so the concepts in Git are a little difficult to get a handle on.   For instance, I am trying to update a branch with the changes from the master so I can continue to use the same branch for new work.
some update to this readme

modified after I created report3
